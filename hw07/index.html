            <p>but first, a message from our sponsors:
              <br>
              <br>Reading Response: I notice we didnt get assigned a reading response this week, but I had already picked some because I thought there would be. And there were cool articles in the regular news, related to programming. I figured if I already read them I might as well re-cap them anyways too.
              <br>The first was a new twitterbot somebody made that inputs Trump's tweets into the official paperwork style of the official Oval Office Press Releases:  <a href = "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/15/business/media/trump-twitter-bots.html">https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/15/business/media/trump-twitter-bots.html</a>
              <br>The story goes that a former White  House staffer (under Obama) jokingly posted a single tweet of Trumps in the Official style. Then a random programmer saw it and decided to make a bot do that to ALL of Trump's tweets. Even more inspiring is that he threw the bot together in an hour! It doesn't look as good as the White House staffer's original, but he built on the idea, and that collaborative power of the internet is pretty swift and amazing.
              I even think I understand how that code might be written. The next hurdle (which is huge) is actually just noticing those moments, and deciding to make the thing.

              <br><br>

              The second was more of a wormhole thru a few articles. This hero vigilante programmer guy, Marcus Hutchins, notoriously saved England early this year from a crazy North Korean Ransomware called WannaCry that was ransoming all kinds of infrastructure and hospitals. He apparently looked at an excerpt of the virus's code, saw that parts were pointing to a URL that wasnt registered, registered it himself not knowing what that might do. Turned out to be the off-switch, so he sorta accidently saved the UK. Well, just this week while he was in America for a DefCon Security Conference, he suddenly got arrested out of nowhere by the FBI, -- for alledgedly creating/distributing the Kronos virus, 3 years ago in 2014! So thats actually a bunch of different articles, the one about his arrest links off into multiple directions, to articles of his earlier heroics, as well as to North Korea's relatively drastic rise in Cyberpower, and how they've been accomplishing pretty huge things under the radar:
              <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/15/world/asia/north-korea-hacking-cyber-sony.html">https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/15/world/asia/north-korea-hacking-cyber-sony.html</a>
              <br>But what actually kind of interested me the most is this 2014 article about the Kronos Malware itself ('The Father of Zeus: Kronos Malware Discovered' <a href = "http://securityintelligence.com/the-father-of-zeus-kronos-malware-discovered/"> http://securityintelligence.com/the-father-of-zeus-kronos-malware-discovered/</a>)
              what I find most interesting here is at the end they include this translation of the original text from the Russian underground forum they were selling Kronos on:
            </p>
   <h2>
    <br>I present you a new banking Trojan
    <br>
    <br>Compatible with 64 and 32bit rootkit Trojan is equipped with the tools to give you successful banking actions.Formgrabber: Works on Chrome, IE, FF in latest versions. Works on the majority of older versions as well. Steals logs from each website Webinjects: Works on latest Chrome, IE, FF, latest and majority of older versions. Injections are in Zeus config format, so it’s easy to transfer the config from one another.32 and 64bit Ring3 rootkit: The Trojan also has a ring 3 rootkit that defends it from other Trojans.
    <br>
    <br>Proactive Bypass: The Trojan uses an undetected injection method to work in a secure process and bypass proactive anti-virus protections. Encrypted Communication: Connection between bot and panel is encrypted to protect against sniffers. Usermode Sandbox and rootkit bypass: The Trojan is able to bypass any hook in usermode functions which bypasses rootkits or sandboxes which use these hooks.
    <br>
    <br>1000$ a week of testing. The server will be hosted only for you. You need just a domain or a payment including the domain fee. You’ll have full access to the C&C, without any limits or restrictions during test mode.7000$ Lifetime product license, free updates and bug removals. New modules will not be free , and you will need to pay additionally. We accept Perfect Money, Bitcoin, WMZ, BTC-E.comCurrently the Trojan is written in its fullest. Next week we will have tests and bug fixing, then release. Pre-ordering the Trojan will give you a discount.
  </h2>
<p><br>Anyways, I just find it interesting that I'm able to understand more and more what these things mean, & how regular humans are behind all these things, the good & the evil, and sometimes both. Also I'm imagining that hopefully soon one day I'll be able to watch 'Hackers' again or any other old movie involving people saying random gobbledygook at a computer while they pretend to hit buttons, and how different my experience with it will be. Now, back to our regularly scheduled programming:
